This project marks my first attempt at working with Javascript. In addition to learning the basics of Javascript syntax, I also learned how to:

- Generate random numbers within a specificied range.
- Create functions and call them from inside another.
- Use simple loops to repeat code.
- Create and reference arrays (though I did away with them for simplicity).
- Use conditional statements and comparisons.
- Increment values.
- Use prompts and reformat user input appropriately.
